Windows 11 Client Domain Join

This document outlines the process of joining a Windows 11 client machine to the Active Directory domain within the enterprise sysadmin lab environment.

🖥️ Client Machine Overview

Machine Name: CLIENT01
Operating System: Windows 11 Pro
Network Type: DHCP enabled

The client is connected to the internal lab network through Hyper-V.

🌐 Network Prerequisites

Before joining the domain, the following were verified:

Client received IP address from DHCP

DNS server pointed to DC01

Network connectivity to Domain Controller confirmed

Verification Command:
ipconfig /all


Confirmed valid IP address (not APIPA) and correct DNS configuration.

🔗 Domain Join Process

Steps performed:

Opened System Settings

Navigated to About → Domain or Workgroup

Selected Join a domain

Entered:

lab.local


Provided domain administrator credentials

Restarted client machine

✅ Post-Join Validation

After reboot:

Logged in using domain user account

Confirmed computer object appeared in Active Directory

Verified domain connectivity

🛠 Troubleshooting Encountered
Issue: Client initially received APIPA address (169.254.x.x)

Cause: No DHCP/static configuration
Fix: Configured proper DHCP/DNS settings

Issue: Domain join failed initially

Cause: DNS misconfiguration
