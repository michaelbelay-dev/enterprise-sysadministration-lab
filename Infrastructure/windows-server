Virtual Machine Creation 

Hypervisor: Hyper-V
VM Name: DC01
Operating System: Windows Server

Configuration:

Generation 2 VM

Adequate RAM and CPU assigned for lab usage

Connected to internal virtual switch (Lab_Internal)

Windows Server ISO mounted for installation

📀 Windows Server Installation

Steps performed:

Booted VM using Windows Server ISO

Installed Windows Server (Desktop Experience) 

Completed initial setup and administrator account creation

Logged into Windows Server desktop

🌐 Network Configuration (Static IP)

Domain Controllers require static IP addresses.

Configured DC01 with:

Static IPv4 address (same subnet as lab network)

Subnet mask configured

Preferred DNS set to itself (loopback or DC01 IP)

Verification:
ipconfig /all


Confirmed static IP and DNS configuration.

🏢 Active Directory Domain Services Installation

Steps:

Opened Server Manager

Added Active Directory Domain Services role

Promoted server to Domain Controller

Created new forest:

lab.local


Completed reboot after promotion

📡 DNS Configuration

DNS installed automatically with AD DS.

Confirmed:

DNS service running

DC01 listed as primary DNS server

Domain name resolving correctly
✅ Post-Setup Validation

Verified:

Domain Controller operational

Active Directory Users and Computers accessible

DNS service functioning

Server reachable over network

🧠 Notes & Best Practices

Domain Controllers should always use static IP addressing

DNS must point to the Domain Controller for domain joins

Internal virtual switch isolates lab safely

Always verify IP configuration before client joins
